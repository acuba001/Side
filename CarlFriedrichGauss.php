									Carl Friedrich Gauss was born on 30 April 1777 in Brunswick (Braunschweig), in the Duchy of 
									Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel (now part of Lower Saxony, Germany), as the son of poor working-class 
									parents. His mother was illiterate and never recorded the date of his birth, remembering only 
									that he had been born on a Wednesday, eight days before the Feast of the Ascension, which 
									itself occurs 39 days after Easter. Gauss later solved this puzzle about his birthdate in the 
									context of finding the date of Easter, deriving methods to compute the date in both past and 
									future years. He was christened and confirmed in a church near the school he attended as a child.
									<br><br>
									At the age of eight, he one day was punished by the teacher for his class for misconduct and was 
									given a seemly tedious problem to solve as the punishment. The problem was to find the sum of all 
									the numbers from 1 to 100. He was able to answer this problem in no time. The reason why this 
									anecdote is famous is because that type of problem is a problem that reoccurs in fields of 
									mathematics such as Combinatorics and Calculus which are very deep and difficult fields in 
									mathematics for an 8 year old =P

									The year 1796 was most productive for both Gauss and number theory. He discovered a construction 
									of the heptadecagon (17-gon) givan any arbitrary side length on 30 March. The below is a video that illustrates the methods in 
									which some regular polygons are made using straight edge and compass. They seem to get more 
									complicate as the number of vertices increases.
