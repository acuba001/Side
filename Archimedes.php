									Archimedes was an ancient Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, and astronomer who lived around 
									c.287 BC â€“ c.212 BC. He was arguably the most brilliant person who lived in his era. One of his many 
									great accomplishments, approximating and comparing volumes of three dimensional objects. There is evidence 
									of him using computations that resemble limits from calculus so arguably Archimedes can be named as the 
									founder of Calculus. Along with geometric computations, He was known to create war machines that were created 
									to protect the people and land he lived with and on.

									The most widely known anecdote about Archimedes tells of how he invented a method for determining the volume of 
									an object with an irregular shape. According to Vitruvius, a votive crown for a temple had been made for King 
									Hiero II, who had supplied the pure gold to be used, and Archimedes was asked to determine whether some silver 
									had been substituted by the dishonest goldsmith. Archimedes had to solve the problem without damaging the crown,
									 so he could not melt it down into a regularly shaped body in order to calculate its density. While taking a bath, 
									 he noticed that the level of the water in the tub rose as he got in, and realized that this effect could be used 
									 to determine the volume of the crown. For practical purposes water is incompressible, so the submerged crown would 
									 displace an amount of water equal to its own volume. By dividing the mass of the crown by the volume of water 
									 displaced, the density of the crown could be obtained. This density would be lower than that of gold if cheaper 
									 and less dense metals had been added. Archimedes then took to the streets naked, so excited by his discovery that 
									 he had forgotten to dress, crying "Eureka!" (meaning "I have found it!"). The test was conducted successfully, 
									 proving that silver had indeed been mixed in. The following is good documentary on Archimede's life accomplishments.
